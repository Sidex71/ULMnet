Description: A novel approach to depict physical cell-cell interactions from scRNAseq datasets using cell type-specifc gene signatures.
             This method utilizes univariate linear models to identify and predict the cellular composition of multiplets in scRNAseq by assigning signature scores to cellular barcodes. All cells or barcodes that are enriched in more than one celltype specific gene signatures are considered as multiplet. 
             Physical cell-cell interaction networks can then be plotted from the multiplet data. Further downstream analysis can also be performed from multipet data to gain potential biological insights on the ongoing interactions.
